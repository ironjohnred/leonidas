### Ponder

```
Only you are responsible for your feelings. Nobody else is.
Most people blame how they feel on someone else.
No. Other people can try to provoke a feeling from you, but you choose how to respond.

Fragile = deteriorates under attack/pressure
Robust = resistant to attack/pressure
Antifragile = improves from attack/pressure

```
